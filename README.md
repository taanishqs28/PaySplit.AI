# PaySplit.AI

**PaySplit.AI** is a portfolio-ready SaaS project designed for freelancers, gig workers, and side hustlers to track and manage their finances.  
It enables users to upload bank transaction CSVs, view summaries, and lays the foundation for advanced AI-powered categorization and tax estimation.

> This project demonstrates production-grade backend API development (FastAPI, PostgreSQL), robust error handling, modular design, and a clear roadmap for future extensibility (AI, frontend, multi-user, etc.).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. **Navigate to the server folder**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the backend**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 4000
    ```

5. **Test in your browser:**
    - Visit http://localhost:4000/docs
    - Upload a sample .csv to the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint
